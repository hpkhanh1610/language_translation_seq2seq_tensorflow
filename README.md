# Language Translation using Sequence-to-Sequence model in Tensorflow
In this project, we’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation.  We’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

## Instructions:
Please run the notebook `dlnd_language_translation.ipynb` for more details.
